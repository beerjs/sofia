# BeerJS Sofia


BeerJS Sofia is a gathering group for Sofia (and visitors!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript! Currently we organize events at [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/292135280802776/), but we're experimenting here as well.

## Next meetup?

13th of June, 8pm at "Halbite 2", [[map](https://www.google.bg/maps/place/bulevard+%22Praga%22+18/@42.6883067,23.3121252,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x40aa8516afccc5e7:0x824c2e20af9b0704)], [[RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/1438660926393588/)]
