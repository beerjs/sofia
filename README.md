# BeerJS Sofia


BeerJS Sofia is a gathering group for Sofia (and visitors!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript! Currently we organize events at [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/292135280802776/), but we're experimenting here as well.

## Why GitHub?
