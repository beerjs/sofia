# BeerJS Sofia


BeerJS SF is a gathering group for Sofia (and visitors!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript! Currently we organize events at [meetup.com/beerjs](http://www.meetup.com/beerjs), but we're experimenting here as well.

## Why Github?

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.  
* Less spam
* Because GitHub is free and [Meetup.com is not](http://www.meetup.com/help/Does-it-cost-money-to-start-a-Meetup-Group), which means more beer money!
