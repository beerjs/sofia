# BeerJS Sofia


BeerJS Sofia is a gathering group for Sofia (and visitors!) to get together for activities revolving around two things, beer and JavaScript! Currently we organize events at [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/292135280802776/), but we're experimenting here as well.

## Next event

The next event of Beer.js Sofia is on 24th of August at [Maimunarnika](https://www.google.bg/maps/place/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/@42.6832978,23.3428281,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x40aa85a34779b017:0x18502968816b6d98).
